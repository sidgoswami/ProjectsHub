# Posture Analysing

With the increased amount of sedantary work, people are losing the ability to maintain a proper posture. Long hours of sitting on the desk is affecting people's back strength which inturn is resulting in a back pain.

This WebAPI exposes the ability to check if the posture is correct using three sensors fixed on the back of a person. The sensors fixed at the Cervical, Thoracic and Lumbar portions of the back are supposed to measure the angles they make. For them to read proper data, they can be mounted on a tight fit shirt like the one made up of spandex material, so they can remain close to the body for a perfect read. The data from these sensors can then be sent to the API to validate if the posture of the body is correct.

The normal angle ranges for different sections of the spine is based on the Approximate normal values for those areas found on the internet. This includes - 
Cervical between 19.4 to 21.4 degrees, 
Thoracic between 45.1 to 49.0 and 
Lumbar between 39.7 to 40.0.
